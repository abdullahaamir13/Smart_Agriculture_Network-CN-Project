# Smart Agriculture Network for Precision Farming

This repository contains a compiled PDF and a Cisco Packet Tracer `.pkt` file for a lab manual focused on designing and implementing a Smart Agriculture Network tailored to Precision Farming in Pakistan. The manual covers IoT device setup, routing protocol configurations (OSPF, RIP, EIGRP), and automation integration.

## Overview

The project demonstrates a scalable network for precision farming, integrating IoT devices to monitor parameters like temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The `.pkt` file provides a simulated network topology, while the PDF offers a detailed lab manual.
